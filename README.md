This project aims to look at the list of bowlers in test cricket and present a comprehensive analysis, focusing on some key performance indicators, such as Bowling Averages and Economy rates for different countries. We further try and differentiate these stats based on bowling type.

We use data from Howstat (http://www.howstat.com/cricket/Statistics/Bowling/BowlingAggregates.asp) to find out correlations between various factors such as the handedness of the bowler (left or right), the type of bowling (fast bowling, off-spin, and leg spin), and the countries in which the bowlers have played in (Australia, Bangladesh, England, India, New Zealand, Pakistan, South Africa, Sri Lanka, West Indies). We ended up picking the 4 countries out of these to explore that are major in the game of cricket (England and Wales, South Africa, India and Australia) The main objective is to explore these relationships and then make informed predictions based on bowlers' performances. By analyzing these statistics, we look to provide important insights as to what kinds of bowlers should be preferred by teams based on the country they are playing in.
